# slower, due to compinit being called multiple times, or will cause errors
# from functions not being found.
# The FPATH will likely only contain these dirs:
# - /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions
# - /usr/share/zsh/site-functions
# - /usr/share/zsh/5.9/functions
# We can enable caching and apply other settings like that, though
